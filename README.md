# Pharmacy-Stock-Management-System

Course: Advanced Database Management System (ADBMS)

## Summary

Any contemporary, data-driven business produces significant data through its various operations. Due to differences in business operations, systems, and procedures, it is essential that the data be appropriately consolidated, cleaned to reduce noise, and converted to allow for meaningful analytics. To achieve this, a data modeling process must be performed to systematically arrange the data and store it in a format that can be used for a variety of applications. When building a new database or reengineering an existing one, data models act as a road map. To create relationships and make sense of the data, many tools including tables, graphs, nesting, and more were used. One sort of data modeling that makes use of constraints to create relationships between different entities is object-relational mapping. While NoSQL uses buckets and hierarchical documents for the same purpose, Relational Schema uses keys to map data. The focus of this project is to put these strategies into practice while maintaining a unified theme. The Pharmacy Stock Management database will be developed by using ORM, Relational Schema, and NoSQL approach. 

## Introduction

Any business requires inventory management, stock visibility, and dedicated systems that help analyze and make key business decisions. In this project, we have taken the example of a pharmacy store chain operating in several franchises. The inventory management database is designed to capture store details, manufacturer details, product details, on-hand inventory, daily transactions, and sales. The tables are designed so that they can be used to analyze and create dashboards for critical KPIs such as total sales per store, the product with the highest sales, average amount per cheque, tracking different lot codes of the same product, shelf-life analysis, and replenishment levels. Customer, Manufacturer, Products (Medicine), Stores, Inventory, Price, Customer Order (Master), and Order details are the primary tables and entities involved in this project. Each store or pharmacy will purchase the appropriate amount of goods (medication) from the authorized manufacturer and stock them in an inventory with all its information. When a customer visits a pharmacy to buy drugs, the medications are then sold to that customer. Therefore, all the entities stated above are quite interconnected with one another. The overall sales for any given store can be obtained using the Customer Order (Master) entity, and specific order information can be obtained using the Order details table. This aids in minimizing the complexity level of each query. The entities and tables used in this project allow us to utilize a variety of joints to extract the proper information. For instance, by joining the price table and the inventory table, we can analyze the current on-hand cost of the whole pharmacy. It is therefore created in a way that makes easy analysis, replenishment, and important business decisions possible.

## Context

Since drugs are essential to the healthcare sector, technology has been crucial to the expansion of the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. Medication administration requires extreme caution because it can potentially reduce suffering and speed up recovery from illnesses. By automating the inventory management process thereby improving visibility and traceability, the Pharmacy Stocks Management System will help to guarantee that the pharmacy has an adequate supply of drugs and supplies to meet patients' demands. It is crucial for pharmacies to make sure they have enough drug stock to meet the needs of the patients. Pharmacies use manual inventories to monitor their stock levels, but they are time-consuming and subject to human errors. Inventory management is the heart of every supply chain industry, especially pharmaceuticals. Each pharmaceutical entity requires granular inventory visibility and traceability so that proper replenishment levels can be established. The traceability component helps track shelf life and address any inventory discrepancies to ensure the highest quality of service to the customers while maintaining quality standards. By using this system, pharmacies can keep track of their inventory and replenish any medications that are running out of stock.
